# Rails SSE

This is a repository that goes together with [a blog post about Server-Sent Events in Rails](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/using-server-sent-events-to-stream-data-in-rails/).

## Running

```
bundle install
bin/rails server
```

Then, visit http://localhost:3000 and observe how events are coming in from the server.
